In today's lab, you'll use simple linear regression to analyze the relationship between the median early career salary and percent of alumni who perceive their job as making the world a better place for colleges and universities in the United States. You will also start working with your lab teams and be introduced to using GitHub for collaboration. 

# Learning goals

By the end of the lab you will...

- Be able to fit a simple linear regression model using R. 
- Be able to interpret the slope and intercept for the model. 
- Be able to use statistical inference to draw conclusions about the slope 
- Gain experience using GitHub for collaboration. 


# Meet your team!

See the [STA 210 teams document](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/mt324_duke_edu/EWg7OIgezXZDp0JKm6bczCMBlgrGCunFKz12Ru0Zoa0IeA?e=g0DEDw) to see your team assignment. This will be your team for labs and the final project.

Before you get started on the lab assignment, your TA will walk you through 

- An icebreaker activity to get to know your teammates
- The workflow when using GitHub as a team. 

By the end of the lab session, you should come up with a new team name. You can't use the same team name as another team, so be creative! Your TA will come around to record your team name by the end of lab.

# Getting Started

A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.

-   Go to [STA 210 course organization](https://www.github.com/sta210-sp21) on GitHub.

-   In addition to your private individual repositories, you should now see a repo named **lab-03**. Go to that repository.

-   Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. **Do not make any changes to the .Rmd file until the instructions tell you do to so.**

## Workflow: Using git and GitHub as a team

**Assign each person on your team a number 1 through 4. For teams of three, Member 1 can take on the role of Member 4.**

The following exercises must be done in order. **Only one person should type in the .Rmd file and push updates at a time.** When it is not your turn to type, you should still share ideas and contribute to the team's discussion.

## Update YAML

**Team Member 1: Change the author to your team name and include each team member's name in the `author` field of the YAML in the following format. `Team Name: Member 1, Member 2, Member 3, Member 4`.**

## Packages

We will use the following packages in today's lab.

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
# add additional packages as needed
```

# Data: Recent college graduates

Today's data are two data sets that were part of [TidyTuesday College tuition, diversity, and pay](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md). All of the information is originally from the Department of Education but was collected from various websites.

We will use the following two data sets in this lab:

## `alumni` data set

The information in this data set was collected from the [PayScale College Salary Report](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors).

## Load data

The data set for this lab will focus on higher education institutions where the median early career pay is \$70,000 or less and that are included in both data sets.


```{r echo = F, eval = F}
#clean data to prepare for lab
# remove duplicates + only keep observations in both data sets
alumni <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/salary_potential.csv')

tuition_cost <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/tuition_cost.csv')

alumni_keep <- semi_join(alumni, tuition_cost, by = c("name", "state_name" = "state"))

alumni_keep %>% write_csv("data/alumni-salaries.csv")

tuition_keep <- semi_join(tuition_cost, alumni,  c("name", "state" = "state_name"))

tuition_keep %>% write_csv("data/tuition.csv")
```

```{r}
alumni <- read_csv("data/alumni-salaries.csv")

# Exercises

## Instructions

Is there a relationship between someone's early career salary and whether they perceive their job as making the world a better place? To answer this question, we will use linear regression to fit a model using the percent of alumni who perceive their job is making the world a better place to predict the median early career salary for colleges and universities in the United States.

::: {.commit}
<b>Team Member 1</b>: Type the team's responses to exercises 1 - 4.
:::

**Some observations have missing values for `make_world_better_percent`. Before you get started, filter the `alumni` data frame so you only have observations that have data for both `make_world_better_percent` and `early_career_pay`.**

1.  Plot the distribution of the response variable and calculate the appropriate summary statistics. Describe the distribution including the shape, center, spread, and any outliers.

2.  Plot the distribution of explanatory variable and calculate the appropriate summary statistics. Describe the distribution including the shape, center, spread, and any outliers.

3.  What do you expect the relationship to be between the percent of alumni who perceive their jobs of making the world a better place and the typical career salary? Discuss as a group and summarize the group's thoughts.

4.  Create a visualization to display the relationship between `early_career_pay` and `make_world_better_percent`. Use the scatter plot to describe the relationship between the two variables. Is the relationship what your group expected? Why or why not?

1.  Fit a simple linear regression model for the relationship between early career pay and perceiving their job as making the world a better place. Display the code and output, include a confidence interval for the coefficient, and use the `kable` function to neatly display the model output with 3 digits.

2.  Interpret the slope in the context of the problem.

3.  Does it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, interpret the intercept. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.

1.  Is the linear relationship between `early_career_pay` and `make_world_better_percent` statistically significant?

    -   State the null and alternative hypotheses used to answer this question in words and in mathematical notation.
    -   What is the test statistic? Write the equation used to calculate the test statistic.
    -   What distribution was used to calculate the p-value?
    -   State your conclusion for the test in the context of the data.

2.  Interpret the 95% confidence interval for the slope in the context of the data.

```

1.  For the remainder of the lab, we will consider differences between private and public institutions. The institution type is in the `tuition_cost` data frame. Join `tuition_cost` and `alumni` to create a single data frame. *Hint: You need to consider the name and state, since there are some states with colleges of the same name.*
