The goal for this lab is to identify 2 - 3 potential data sets to use for the final project. The objective of this task is to give you enough time to find a data set that will help you be successful on the project. 

# Getting started

## Clone assignment repo + start new project

A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.

- Go to [course organization](https://www.github.com/sta210-sp21) on GitHub.

- In addition to your private individual repositories, you should now see a repo named **project-**. Go to that repository.
  
- Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio.

# Topic ideas 

Go to the [Project](https://sta210-sp21.netlify.app/project/) page on the course website and read in the introduction to the project an the **Topic Ideas** section.
