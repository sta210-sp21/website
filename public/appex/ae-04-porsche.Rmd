## Introducing LaTex

To write mathematical notation, we will use LaTex, a documentation software specifically for technical writing. We can write equations in two ways:

**Inline:**  Your mathematics will display within the line of text.

- Use `$` to start and end your LaTex syntax.
- Example: The R Markdown text `The null hypothesis is $H_0:\beta_1 = 0$` is rendered as "The null hypothesis is $H_0:\beta_1 = 0$

**Displayed:** Your mathematics will display outside the line of text

Use `$$` to start and end your LaTex syntax.
Example: The R Markdown text `The null hypothesis is $$H_0:\beta_1 = 0$$` is rendered as "The null hypothesis is $$H_0: \beta_1 = 0$$

One way we will use LaTex is to write model equations: 

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$

Syntax: `$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$`

**Note:** You **<u>cannot</u>** copy and paste mathematical symbols in LaTex. If you do so, you will get a "Unicode" error message when you try to knit the document. 

See [Mathematics in R Markdown](https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html) for an overview of the syntax for commonly used equations and symbols.
