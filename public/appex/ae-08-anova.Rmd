## Questions about lab

## Writing practical interpretations 

Suppose we fit a model to predict a song's popularity based on its duration (in milliseconds). 

$$\hat{popularity} = 86.65 - 0.00001207 \times duration\_ms$$

- Write the interpretation of the slope. Is this interpretation useful? Why or why not? 
- If not, how can we improve it?
