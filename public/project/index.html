<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>Pick a data set and do a regression analysis. That is your
final project.</em></p>
<p>The goal of the final project is for you to use regression analysis to analyze a data set of your own choosing. The data set may already exist or you may collect your own data by scraping the web.</p>
<p>Choose the data based on your group&rsquo;s interests or work you all have done in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like!) and apply them to a data set to analyze it in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>All analyses must be done in RStudio, and all components of the project <strong>must be reproducible</strong> (with the exception of the presentation).</p>
<h3 id="logistics">Logistics</h3>
<p>You will work on the project with your lab groups.</p>
<p>The four primary deliverables for the final project are</p>
<ul>
<li>A written, reproducible report detailing your analysis</li>
<li>A GitHub repository corresponding to your report</li>
<li>Slides + a video presentation</li>
<li>Formal peer review on another team&rsquo;s project</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topic-ideas">Topic ideas</h2>
<p>Identify 2-3 data sets you&rsquo;re interested in potentially using for the final project. If you&rsquo;re unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources in the <a href="#tips--resources">Tips + Resources</a> section as a starting point. It may also help to think of topics you&rsquo;re interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.</p>
<p>The purpose of submitting project ideas is to give you time to find data for the project and to make sure you have a data set that can help you be successful in the project. <strong>Therefore, you must use one of the data sets submitted as a topic idea, unless otherwise notified by the teaching team.</strong></p>
<p>The data sets should meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 100 observations</li>
<li>At least 10 columns</li>
<li>At least 6 of the columns must be useful and unique predictor variables.
<ul>
<li>Identifier variables such as &ldquo;name&rdquo;, &ldquo;social security number&rdquo;, etc. are not useful predictor variables.</li>
<li>If you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. &ldquo;state abbreviation&rdquo; and &ldquo;state name&rdquo;), then they are not unique predictors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At least one variable that can be identified as a reasonable response variable.
<ul>
<li>The response variable can be quantitative or categorical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A mix of quantitative and categorical variables that can be used as predictors.</li>
<li>Observations should reasonably meet the independence condition. Therefore, avoid data with repeated measures, data collected over time, etc.</li>
<li><strong>You cannot use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Please ask a member of the teaching team if you&rsquo;re unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.</strong></p>
<h3 id="submission">Submission</h3>
<p>You will submit the topic ideas in the <code>01-topic-ideas</code> folder in the  <code>project</code> repo on GitHub. The submission should include the following for each data set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Short description of the data (1 - 2 sentences).</li>
<li>Description of the variables or link to data dictionary.</li>
<li><code>glimpse</code> of data set</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit your work by pushing it to your GitHub repo by the deadline. The teaching team will submit feedback about your topic ideas using the <strong>Issues</strong> on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="project-proposal">Project proposal</h2>
<p>The purpose of the project proposal is to help you think about your analysis strategy early. s</p>
<p>Include the following in the proposal:</p>

Critically reviewing others' work is a crucial part of the scientific process, and STA 210 is no exception. You will be assigned a team to review. As part of the review process, you must provide your partner team a copy of your current report by **Wednesday, October 28**. After giving the report to your partner team, they will have until **Friday, November 5** to provide a detailed critique about the written report and data analysis. This feedback is intended to help you create a high quality final project, as well as give you experience 
reading and constructively critiquing the work of others.

During the peer review process, you will be provided read-only access to your  partner team's GitHub repo. Provide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team's GitHub repo. 
Peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team's report: the  research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, and any inference, modeling, or conclusions. 

As you work on the draft, the focus should be on the analysis and less on crafting the final report.  **Your draft must include a reasonable attempt at each analysis component - exploratory data analysis, modeling, and preliminary inferential conclusions.**


The final report is due on **Tuesday, November 17.**
-->
<h2 id="written-report">Written report</h2>
<p>Check back for more details.</p>
<!--
Your written report must be done using R Markdown. All team members must contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits. 

Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option `echo = FALSE`. 

Your final report must match your GitHub repository *exactly*. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be **no more than 15 pages long.** There is no minimum page requirement; however, you must comprehensively address all of the aspects mentioned below.

Please be judicious in what you include in your final write-up.

The written report is worth 50 points, broken down as follows

### Introduction and data

This section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.

#### Grading criteria

**(8 pts)** The research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the relevant variables for the analysis. The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data set and interesting relationships between the variables. 


### Methodology 

This section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you're fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, any variable transformations (if needed), and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process. 


#### Grading criteria

**(17 pts)** The analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thoughtful approach to select the final model that took into account potential interaction effects and addressed violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed as appropriate for the model. If violations of model conditions still exist, there was a reasonable attempt to address them, i.e. based on what we’ve learned this semester.


### Results 

This is also where you will output the final model and include a brief discussion of the model assumptions, diagnostics, and any relevant model fit statistics. 

Additionally, interpret the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in answering your research question using the results from the analysis. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader. 

#### Grading criteria 

**(17 pts)** The model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is assessed.

### Discussion

This section is a conclusion and discussion. This will require a 
summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. Also, critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Include 1 - 2 paragraphs on what you would do differently if you were able to start over with the project or what you would do next if you were going to continue work on the project should also be included.

#### Grading criteria 

**(4 pts)** Overall conclusions from analysis are clearly described. The group has thoughtfully considered potential limitations of their data and/or analysis and presented potential ideas to address these limitations and avenues to explore in future work. 

**(4 pts)** The final write up is neatly organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. Overall, the document would be presentable in a business or research setting.

<h2 id="video-presentation--slides">Video presentation + slides</h2>
<p>Check back for more details.</p>
<!--
In addition to the write-up, your team must also create presentation
slides that summarize and showcase your project. Introduce your research question and data set, showcase visualizations, and provide some conclusions. These slides should serve as a brief visual accompaniment to your write-up and will be graded for content and quality. For submission, convert these slides to a .pdf document to be submitted to Gradescope. The slides are due on **Friday, November 20**.

The slide deck should have no more than 6 content slides + 1 title slide. Here is a *<u>suggested</u>* outline as you think through the slides; you do *<u>not</u>* have to use this exact format for the 6 slides.

- Title Slide
- Slide 1: Introduce the topic and motivation
- Slide 2: Introduce the data
- Slide 3: Highlights from EDA
- Slide 4: Final model
- Slide 5: Interesting findings from the model
- Slide 6: Conclusions + future work

## Video presentation

By **Friday, November 20**, your group will upload a video presentation of your project to Warpwire. Note that all members must present, and that a ten-minute time limit is **strictly enforced**.

For the presentation, you can speak over your slide deck, similar to the lecture content videos. I recommend using Zoom to record your presentation; however, you can use whatever platform works best for your group. Below are a few resources to help you record video presentations:

- [Recording presentations in Zoom](https://kb.siue.edu/61721)
- [Apple Quicktime for screen recording]( https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/quicktime-player/qtp97b08e666/mac)
- [Windows 10 built-in screen recording functionality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfPbr1mRDuo)
- [Kap for screen recording](https://getkap.co/)

You will post the presentation video in Warpwire, which is accessible from the the course Sakai site (bottom of the left-hand tool bar). 

**To upload your video to Warpwire:**

- Click the Warpwire tab in the course Sakai site.
- Click the “+” and select “Upload files”.
- Locate the video on your computer and click to upload.
- Once you’ve uploaded the video to Warpwire, click to share the video and make
a copy of the video’s URL. You will need this when you post the video in the
discussion forum.

**To post the video to the discussion forum:**

- Click the Presentations tab in the course Sakai site. 
- Click the Presentations topic. 
- Click "Start New Presentation". 
- Make the title "Your Team Name: Project Title". For example, "Teaching Team: Analysis of Cars in the US".
- Click the Warpwire icon (between the flag and shopping cart icons).
- Select your video, then click “Insert 1 item.” This will embed your video in the conversation.
- Under the video, paste the URL to your video.
- You’re done! 

You can see the Teaching team example in Sakai.

<h2 id="presentation-comments">Presentation comments</h2>
<p>Check back for more details.</p>
<!--
Each student will be assigned 2 presentations to watch. [Click here](https://prodduke-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/mt324_duke_edu/EfYgmTXEMs1ImpYXagtwYbQBbaUa9_bPI_2D7cTBSdhJ8w?e=O2eeUD) to see your viewing assignments. 

Watch the group's video, then click "Reply" to post a question for the group. You may not post a question that's already been asked on the discussion thread. Additionally, the question should be (i) substantive (i.e. it shouldn't be "Why did you use a bar plot instead of a pie chart"?), (ii) demonstrate your understanding of the content from the course, and (iii) relevant to that group's specific presentation, i.e demonstrating that you've watched the presentation. 

You may start posting questions and comments on Sat, Nov 21 at 12 EST. **All questions must be posted by Sun, Nov 22 at 11:59p EST**. 

**<i>This portion of the project will be assessed individually.</i>**
--> 
<h2 id="reproducibilty---organization">Reproducibilty +  organization</h2>
<p>All written work (with exception of presentation slides) should be reproducible, and the GitHub repo should be neatly organized.</p>
<p>The GitHub repo should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>README</code>: Short project description and data dictionary</li>
<li><code>/data/*</code>: Data set in the <code>/data</code> folder.</li>
<li><code>/topic-ideas</code>: Potential topics and data sets from earlier in the semester</li>
<li><code>/proposal</code>: Proposal from earlier in the semester</li>
<li><code>/written-report</code>: Written report</li>
<li><code>/presentation</code>: Presentation slides</li>
</ul>
<p>Style and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your data and code are properly formatted.</p>
<h2 id="peer-teamwork-evaluation">Peer teamwork evaluation</h2>
<p>You will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member by assigning a contribution percentage for each team member. Filling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than  half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please
provide some explanation. If any individual gets an average peer score
indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="grading-summary">Grading summary</h3>
<p>Grading of the project will take into account the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy
of data to those questions?</li>
<li>Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?</li>
<li>Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation,
writing, and explanations?</li>
<li>Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the
limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into
the planning and implementation of the project?</li>
</ul>
<p>A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>90%-100%</em>: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical
concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in
the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.</li>
<li><em>80%-89%</em>: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together
an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates
most results clearly to others.</li>
<li><em>70%-79%</em>: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several
areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication
of results is sometimes unclear.</li>
<li><em>60%-69%</em>: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding
of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication
of results is unclear.</li>
<li><em>Below 60%</em>: Student is not making a sufficient effort.</li>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ask questions if any of the expectations are
unclear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Code</em>: In your write up your code should be hidden (<code>echo = FALSE</code>) so that your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your Rmd file I should be able to obtain the results you presented.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exception:</strong> If you want to highlight something
specific about a piece of code, you&rsquo;re welcome to show that portion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merge conflicts will
happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Commit and push often, and ask questions when stuck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure each team member is contributing, both in terms of quality and quantity of contribution (we will be reviewing commits from different team  members).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of this assignment and group assessments will be given at its completion - anyone judged to not have sufficient contributed to the final product will have their grade penalized. While different teams members may have different backgrounds and abilities, it is the responsibility of every team member to understand how and why all code and approaches in  the assignment works.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="formatting--communication">Formatting + communication</h3>
<h4 id="suppress-code-warnings--messages">Suppress Code, Warnings, &amp; Messages</h4>
<ul>
<li>Include the following code in a code chunk at the top of your .Rmd file to suppress all code, warnings, and other messages. Use the code chunk header <code>{r set-up, include = FALSE}</code> to suppress this set up code.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre style=";-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-r" data-lang="r">knitr<span style="color:#666">::</span>opts_chunk<span style="color:#666">$</span><span style="color:#00f">set</span>(echo <span style="color:#666">=</span> <span style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold">FALSE</span>,
                      warning <span style="color:#666">=</span> <span style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold">FALSE</span>, 
                      message <span style="color:#666">=</span> <span style="color:#008000;font-weight:bold">FALSE</span>)
</code></pre></div><h4 id="headers">Headers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use headers to clearly label each section. Make sure there is a space between the last <code>#</code> and the title, so the header renders correctly. For example, <code>###Section Title</code> will not render as header, but <code>### Section Title</code> will.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="references">References</h4>
<ul>
<li>Include all references in a section called &ldquo;References&rdquo; at the end of the report.</li>
<li>This course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.</li>
<li>See <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/bibliography.html">Section 4.5</a> of the R Markdown Cookbook to learn about the citation functionality in R Markdown.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="appendix">Appendix</h4>
<ul>
<li>If you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called &ldquo;Appendix&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The items in the appendix should be properly labeled.</li>
<li>The appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="resize-figures">Resize figures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Resize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.
<ul>
<li><strong>Resize individual figures</strong>: Use the code chunk header <code>{r plot1, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}</code>, replacing <code>plot1</code> with a meaningful label and the height and width with values appropriate for your write up.</li>
<li><strong>Resize all figures</strong>: Include the <code>fig_width</code> and <code>fig_height</code> options in your YAML header as shown below:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Your Title&quot;
author: &quot;Team Name + Group Members&quot;
output: 
  pdf_document:
    fig_width: 5
    fig_height: 3
---
</code></pre><p>Replace the height and width values with values appropriate for your write up.</p>
<h4 id="arranging-plots">Arranging plots</h4>
<p>Arrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using ggplot2 functions, the <code>patchwork</code> package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples <a href="https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&rsquo;re using base R function, i.e. when using the <code>emplogit</code> functions, put the code <code>par(mfrow = c(rows,columns))</code> before the code to make the plots. For example, <code>par(mfrow = c(2,3))</code> will arrange plots in a grid with 2 rows and 3 columns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="plot-titles-and-axis-labels">Plot titles and axis labels</h4>
<p>Be sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use informative titles, <u>not</u> variable names, for titles and axis labels.</li>
<li>Use <code>coord_flip()</code> to flip the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes on the plot. This is useful if you a bar plot with an x-axis that is difficult to read due to overlapping text.</li>
</ul>
<p>❌ <strong>NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.</strong></p>

<h4 id="tables-and-model-output">Tables and model output</h4>
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>kable</code> function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.
<ul>
<li>Use the <code>digits</code> argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.</li>
<li>Use the <code>caption</code> argument to add captions to your table.</li>

<h4 id="guidelines-for-communicating-results">Guidelines for communicating results</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t use variable names in your narrative!</strong> Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.
<ul>
<li>❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.</li>
<li>✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car&rsquo;s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Know your audience:</strong> Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid subject matter jargon:</strong> Don&rsquo;t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.</li>
<li><strong>Tell the &ldquo;so what&rdquo;:</strong> Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.
<ul>
<li>❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.</li>
<li>✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tell a story:</strong> All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!</li>
<li><strong>Use one voice:</strong> Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it&rsquo;s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document.</li>
