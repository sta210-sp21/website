# Introduction 

## Clone assignment repo + start new project

A repository has already been created for you and your teammates. Everyone in your team has access to the same repo.

- Go to [course organization](https://www.github.com/sta210-fa20) on GitHub.

- In addition to your private individual repositories, you should now see a repo named **lab-04-**. Go to that repository.
  
- Each person on the team should clone the repository and open a new project in RStudio. **Do not make any changes to the .Rmd file until the instructions tell you do to so.**

## Workflow: Using git and GitHub as a team

**Assign each person on your team a number 1 through 4. For teams of three, Member 1 can take on the role of Member 4.**

The following exercises must be done in order. **Only one person should type in the .Rmd file and push updates at a time.** When it is not your turn to type, you should still share ideas and contribute to the team's discussion.

# Merge Conflicts (uh oh)


```{r fig.margin=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04-candy/merge-no-conflict.png")
```

You may have seen this already through the course of your collaboration in Lab 03. When two collaborators make changes to a file and push the file 
to their repository, git merges these two files.

```{r fig.margin=TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04-candy/merge-conflict.png")
```


If these two files have conflicting content on the same line, git will produce a
**merge conflict**. Merge conflicts need to be resolved manually, as they require a human 
intervention:

```{r fig.margin=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04-candy/merge-conflict-identifiers.png")
```

To resolve the merge conflict, decide if you want to keep only your text, the 
text on GitHub, or incorporate changes from both texts. Delete the conflict 
markers `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` and make the changes you want in the 
final merge.

**Assign numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 to each of your team members** (if only 3 team 
members, just number 1 through 3). Go through the following steps in detail, 
which simulate a merge conflict. Completing this exercise will be part of the 
lab grade.

## Resolving a merge conflict

**Step 1: Everyone** clone the **lab-04-** assignment repo in RStudio and open file **merge-conflict.Rmd**. Configure git if you haven't already done so:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name="your github username", 
               user.email="your email")
```

**Member 4** should look at the group’s repo on GitHub.com to ensure that the other 
members’ files are pushed to GitHub after every step.

**Step 2: Member 1** Change the team name to your team name. *Knit, commit, and push*.

**Step 3: Member 2** Change the team name to something different (i.e., not your
team name). *Knit, commit, and push*. 

You should get an error.

**Pull** and review the document with the merge conflict. Read the error to your teammates. You can also show them the error by sharing your screen. A merge conflict occurred because you edited the same part of the 
document as Member 1. Resolve the conflict with whichever name you want to keep,
then knit, commit and push again.

**Step 4: Member 3** Write some narrative in the space provided. You should get an error.

This time, no merge conflicts should occur, since you edited a different part of
the document from Members 1 and 2. Read the error to your teammates. You can also show them the error by sharing your screen. 

Click to pull.  *Then, knit, commit, and push.*

**Please ask your TA if you have any questions about merge conflicts and collaborating in GitHub.**

# Team agreement 

As you may have noticed from the merge conflict exercise, it is important to have good group communication. The purpose of the team agreement is to help you plan how you will work on assignments and communicate as a group outside of the lab sessions. 

- You can find the team agreement in the **team-agreement** file in your repo. Take a few minutes to discuss the items in the agreement. 

- Select one person from the team to type the group's responses to the items in the team agreement.

- Push the completed agreement to your GitHub repo. Each team member can refer to the document in this repo or download the PDF of the agreement for future reference.

# Packages + data

## Packages

We'll use the following packages in this lab. 

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(patchwork)
# add more packages as needed
```

## Data: Alumni jobs 

Today's data are two data sets that were part of [TidyTuesday College tuition, diversity, and pay](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md). All of the information is originally from the Department of Education but was collected from various websites.

We will use the following two data sets in this lab:

The information in this data set was collected from the [PayScale College Salary Report](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/bachelors).

# Exercises

Is there a relationship between someone's early career salary and whether they perceive their job as making the world a better place? To answer this question, we will build upon the analysis from last week's lab and as we use regression to predict the median early career salary for colleges using the percent of  alumni who perceive their job is making the world a better place. 

**Some observations have missing values for `make_world_better_percent`. Before you get started, filter the `alumni` data frame so you only have observations that have data for both `make_world_better_percent` and `early_career_pay`.**

::: {.commit}
<b>Team Member 1</b>: Type the team's responses to exercises 1 - 2.
:::

1. Fit a linear model that can be used to predict the median early career pay for alumni based on the percent who perceive their job as making the world a better place. Display the code and output, include a confidence interval for the coefficient, and use the `kable` function to neatly display the model output with 3 digits.


2. Calculate the predicted values and residuals from your model and save these results in a data frame. 

::: {.commit}
`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` <b>Team Member 1</b>: Knit, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message again. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.

</b>All other team members</b>: <b>Pull</b> to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the .Rmd file, and you should see the responses to exercises 1- 2.

<b>Team Member 2</b>: It's your turn! Type the team's response to exercise 3.
:::


3. Before using the model for prediction, let's check the model conditions. For each condition (linearity, constant variance, normality, independence), indicate whether it is satisfied and briefly explain your reasoning. Show any plots, tables, and/or calculations used to support your reasoning.

</b>All other team members</b>: <b>Pull</b> to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the .Rmd file, and you should see the responses to exercise 3.

<b>Team Member 3</b>: It's your turn! Type the team's response to exercise 4.
:::

4. At the Colorado School of Mines,  60% of its alumni said their job makes the world a better place. 

  - Calculate the predicted typical early career pay for this university and the appropriate 95% interval. 
  - The actual early career pay at the Colorado School of Mines is $75,600. Based on your analysis, do you find this value surprising? Briefly explain your reasoning. 
  
::: {.commit}
`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` <b>Team Member 3</b>: Knit, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message again. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.

</b>All other team members</b>: <b>Pull</b> to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the .Rmd file, and you should see the responses to exercise 4.

<b>Team Member 4</b>: It's your turn! Type the team's response to exercise 5.
:::

5. Next, let's consider how well the model fits the relationship between the median early career pay and percent who perceive their job as making the world a better. 

  - Calculate $R^2$ and interpret it in the context of the data.
  - Do you think the model is useful for understanding the variability in early career pay? Briefly explain your reasoning.
 
::: {.commit}

`r emo::ji("white_check_mark")` `r emo::ji("arrow_up")` <b>Team Member 4</b>: Knit, commit and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message again. Make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is cleared up afterwards.

<b>All other team members</b>: <b>Pull</b> to get the updated documents from GitHub. Click on the .Rmd file, and you should see the team's completed lab! </b>
